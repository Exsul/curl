Yet another implementation of CURL. You probably should consider using guzzle instead of it. What this project actually does - it allows run several queries with same/updating cookies. It hides all file-level CURL work, you could easily plug your database source with http requests.

And again, after little tune-up (less than 100 lines) you could do same with grizzle. Use it.
